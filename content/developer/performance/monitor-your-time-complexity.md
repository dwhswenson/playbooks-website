Understanding the time complexity of your algorithms helps you predict how they'll perform as your data grows. For scientific software that often processes large datasets, this knowledge is crucial.

Time complexity is usually expressed in Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(n²), O(log n)), which describes how the execution time scales with input size. Common complexities in scientific applications include:

- **O(1)**: Constant time - operations like array access
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time - binary search, balanced trees
- **O(n)**: Linear time - scanning through a dataset once
- **O(n log n)**: Common for efficient sorting algorithms
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic time - often found in nested loops over data
- **O(2ⁿ)**: Exponential time - brute force solutions to combinatorial problems

When working with scientific algorithms, be particularly attentive to operations inside inner loops or those that process your largest data structures.
