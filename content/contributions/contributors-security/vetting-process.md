The vetting process is not meant to be something where you interrogate your
contributors. It is more to say that you shouldn't trust every contribution
blindly. In practice, many of us will look at the GitHub profile of an
unfamiliar contributor, and use a "web of trust" type of approach, where seeing
membership in a known lab's GitHub organization or experience contributing to
know projects as a good sign.

While these are useful signals, they are not foolproof. It is important to
still be distrustful of contributions from unknown sources, and to be
especially careful reviewing pull requests from external contributors.
