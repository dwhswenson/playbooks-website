When starting a new project, it's important to decide where documentation will live within your repository structure. Having a consistent location makes it easier for users and contributors to find the information they need.

A common practice is to use a top-level `docs/` directory to store all documentation-related files, including user guides, API references, and developer guidelines. This approach is recommended by many Python projects and packaging tools.
