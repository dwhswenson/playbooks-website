Title: Live the contributor experience
layout: topic
---
The easiest way to avoid creating a bad experience for a contributor is for the core development team to use the same workflow that an external contributor would need to use.

## What you'll learn

In the section, we'll talk about some ways that the core developer experience
can differ from an external contributor's experience, and how to avoid those
differences. Specifically, we'll cover:

* **Publishing your developer playbook**: Whatever your style guide is, make
  sure external contributors can find it!
* **Working from forks**: You're external contributors will have to work from
  forks, therefore so should you!
* **Generally treating core devs like external contributors**: If you put
  barriers up that only apply to external developers, you might not realize what a
  burden you're creating.
