Why: Benchmarking or scientific testing, preferably automated whenever possible, ensure that the methods maintain their scientific performance and accuracy when the codebase changes. 

### Different benchmarks can have different goals

* Ensure that software improves over time, for example, that speed of calculation for the same task improves, or that scientific accuracy improves, etc.  
* Ensure that software performance doesnâ€™t degrade over time, for example, due to hardware or software updates, bitrot etc.
