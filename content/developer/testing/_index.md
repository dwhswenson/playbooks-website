Thorough testing is essential for scientific software, where accuracy and reliability directly impact research outcomes. This section covers best practices for implementing different types of tests to ensure your code functions correctly.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll discover:

- **Unit testing approaches**: How to test individual components of your software
- **Integration testing strategies**: How to verify components work together correctly
- **Test automation techniques**: How to incorporate tests into your development workflow
- **Regression testing methods**: How to ensure new changes don't break existing functionality
- **Test planning**: How to develop a comprehensive testing strategy

Strong testing practices not only catch bugs but also serve as documentation, facilitate refactoring, and provide confidence in your results. For scientific software, where results may inform important research conclusions, rigorous testing is particularly valuable.
