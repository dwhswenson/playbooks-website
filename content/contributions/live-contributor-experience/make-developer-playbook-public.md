title: Make your developer playbook public
what: >
  The developer playbook / style guide / handbook should be somewhere publicly
  accessible, preferably as a prominent part of the developer-aimed
  documentation.
why: >
  Contributors should be able to find the projectâ€™s software development style,
  etc., so that their contributions can match style and avoid revision cycles.
when: From the beginning
---

As soon as you get started, make the code style and related decisions public.
Keep in mind that your developer playbook is a living document, so don't worry
about deciding on every issue. You can always update it as you go. But having a
public guide will help contributors understand your project's style and
conventions.
