Title: Help users and contributors communicate with you
layout: topic
---

As your project grows, youâ€™ll want separate channels for various types of
communication. This allows you to separate different modes of work (e.g., keep
user support separate from feature development). It becomes important to guide
contributors and users to the right place for each communication type.

## What you'll learn

* **The various types of communication that you should provide guidance on.** This
  includes user support, feature requests, bug reports, and development help.
* **How to get better bug reports from users.** Many users don't have the
  experience to provide good bug reports. You can help them by providing
  guidance on what to include.
* **How to guide people to the right channel.** This includes providing clear
  instructions in your README, issue templates, and other documentation.
* **How to select a channel for each kind of communication.** This includes
  choosing between GitHub issues, a mailing list, a chat room, or other
  communication tools.
