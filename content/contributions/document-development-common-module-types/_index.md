Title: Document development of common module types
layout: topic
---

Many projects include modular structures where external contributors might
create alternative replacement components. It is important to document how to
develop such components, both to help external contributors make contributions
and to help onboard new hires.

## What you'll learn

* **To be sure to provide the big picture context as well.** This is important
  for understanding the role of the module in the larger system.
* **To provide examples of how to implement any type of module.** This helps
  your contributors get started by modifying something they can see working.
* **To help publicize your external contributions.** This rewards contributors
  and encourages more contributions.
