This playbook intends to help projects make it easier for external developers to make useful contributions. The target audience is the leadership of a software project. This document will include aspects of project management and procedures specifically related to working with external contributors and helping the external contributor experience. Topics relevant to internal software development practices may also be relevant to external contributors, but are discussed in other playbooks.

The ideas in this playbook are general and not specific to any programming language or software development platform. However, some of the specific recommendations and/or terminology are for projects hosted on GitHub.
